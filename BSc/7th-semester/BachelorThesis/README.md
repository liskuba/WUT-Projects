# Comics reader application with integrated translation

Abstract

Reading comics is a popular leisure activity. Unfortunately, many comics are created in only one language and often do not receive translation. The goal of our Bachelor Thesis was to create a mobile application for phones with Android system, which task is to enable the translation of comics from English to Polish. The created tool achieved high results (average BLEU score was 0.556) and showed its practical usage. We have described particular components and their functions, and presented how to use the application. We present the results of our tests of each module, as well as of the entire application.
